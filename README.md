## Proactive Monitoring and Auto-Scaling Intelligence


## High-Level Design (HLD)

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level design (HLD) for enhancing a cloud-based observability platform with API health check monitoring. The objective is to provide comprehensive visibility into the health of API endpoints alongside system metrics, enabling automated incident response and scalability insights.

### 2. Objectives

- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Provide comprehensive visibility into the health of API endpoints alongside system metrics.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Develop automated scripts to handle API endpoint failures and degraded performance.
- **Scalability Insights**: Utilize system metrics like CPU utilization to trigger automatic scaling of services in response to API health issues.

### 3. Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **User Interface**: Custom dashboards for visualization.
- **Observability API**: Integration with Datadog for collecting system metrics.
- **Data Aggregation Layer**: Utilizing Logstash and Fluentd for data aggregation.
- **Metrics Storage**: Elasticsearch for storing aggregated metrics data.
- **Alerting System**: Integration with Datadog and Slack for alerting.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Scripts developed in Python and Go for handling API endpoint failures.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Utilizing AWS, GCP, or Azure, with Terraform for automatic scaling.

### 4. Component Details

#### 4.1. API Health Check Monitor

- **Custom Integration**: Develop a module to periodically query API endpoints for health status and performance metrics.
- **Data Collection**: Collect response times, error rates, and status codes from API endpoints, including handling of 500 and 429 HTTP status codes.

#### 4.2. User Interface, Observability API, Data Aggregation, Metrics Storage, and Alerting System

- **Integration**: Extend existing components to incorporate API health check data for visualization, analysis, and alerting.

#### 4.3. Automated Incident Response

- **Response**: Update scripts to include API endpoint-specific incident response actions, such as:
  - Restarting API services in response to 500 HTTP status codes.
  - Scaling services in response to high CPU utilization.
  - Utilizing Terraform for automatic scaling of services in the cloud infrastructure.

### 5. Data Flow

**API Health Check**:
- Custom module periodically queries API endpoints for health status and performance metrics.
- Data is collected and forwarded to the data aggregation layer.

**Data Processing**:
- API health check data is aggregated with existing system metrics in the data aggregation layer.
- Aggregated data is stored in Elasticsearch for analysis and retrieval.

**Alerting and Automation**:
- Alerting system monitors API health metrics alongside system metrics and triggers alerts for anomalies or threshold breaches.
- Automated incident response scripts handle API endpoint failures, degraded performance, and trigger automatic scaling of services.

### 6. Technology Stack

- **API Health Check**: Custom module (Python, Go)
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Datadog
- **Data Aggregation**: Logstash, Fluentd
- **Metrics Storage**: Elasticsearch
- **Scripting and Automation**: Python, Go
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitLab
- **Alerting and Communication**: Slack

### 7. Security and Compliance

- **Access Controls**: Maintain strict access controls for API health check data.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure encryption of data in transit and at rest.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular audits to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

### 8. Deployment Strategy

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Utilize GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Rolling Updates**: Implement rolling updates to minimize downtime during deployments.

### 9. Conclusion

This extended high-level design incorporates API health check monitoring into the observability platform, enabling comprehensive visibility into both system performance and API endpoint health. By integrating API health data into existing monitoring, alerting, and automation workflows, this solution enhances the reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency of cloud-based infrastructures. Automatic scaling of services based on API health issues ensures an adaptive response to changing workload conditions.
